= Deploy a web service in Azure with Terraform and Packer

== 1. Deploy an azure policy
The details are available in the solution folder under C1-Azure Infrastructure Operations
=== 1.1 Goal
Create a policy that ensures all indexed resources in your subscription have tags and deny deployment if they do not.

=== 1.2 Solution
This has been implemented through terraform. The tagging-policy.tf define the policy and tagging-policy-assignment.tf applies this to the subscription level

.Compliance to requirements 

* [x] Write a policy definition to deny the creation of resources that do to have tags (terraform file tagging-policy.tf)

* [x] Apply the policy definition to the subscription with same name tagging policy .  ```policy_definition_id = azurerm_policy_definition.tagging-policy.id``` relates the above policy with this.

* [x] Testing
This is  tested by executing in bash
